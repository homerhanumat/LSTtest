\description{
The Centers for Disease Control collects data on all births registered
in the US (50 states + DC). \code{Natality_2014}, contains a random sample of
10,000 rows and 55 variables related to potential risk factors and outcomes from the CDC data.
}
\details{
Variable names are the same as in the original CDC file.

Variables have been re-coded to translate markers like 99 into \code{NA} and to
self-document the levels of the variables.

Note that the data include only registered births. Fetal deaths are not included.
For reference, there were about 24,000 fetal deaths (20 weeks and thereafter) in the US in 2013. (See \url{http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_08.pdf}.)
This corresponds to about 0.6\% of the births listed in these data. The CDC also
reports about 16,000 infant deaths before age 28 days and another 7500 deaths before age 1 year.

The full set of 3.99 million cases from the CDC are not available
via this \code{{LSTbook}} package. You can install the "dtkaplan/natality2014" package from
GitHub. You will need a laptop or server-based version of R to do this.
